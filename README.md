babylonejs:
texture didn't work chrome so I used firefox
music didn't work ( i don't know why I simply copied you ) 
cross origin problem with chrome even when I have it the files in my localhost ( that's why I switched to firefox )

phaser io:
so much to remember from last year ( didn't used my previous project "fire birds")
assest I got them from phaser website, didn't wanted to focus on graphic this time 
I made scrolling scene ( what I was aiming for) 
game have some bugs ( i.e. infite jumping) otherwise work fine
it took me more time than I thought even that I was copying some of your examples from "game class" example you gave us last semeseter
